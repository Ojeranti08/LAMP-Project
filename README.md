# LAMP-Project
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)


 I have built a LAMP Stack Project by serving PHP websites and applications to my visitors, using Nginx as web server and MySQL as database management system.

 I launched an EC2 Instance and added the necessary security groups with ubuntu server and ssh with keypair to connect to Ubuntu Server OS.
